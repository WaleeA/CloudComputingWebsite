                Currently cloud computing is seen as the practice of using a
                network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store,
                manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal
                computer. The use of this system is growing exponentially as
                companies like Amazon and Microsoft have developed services like
                “Amazon Web Services” and “Microsoft Azure” for enterprises.
                Back in April 2012, it was reported that the Amazon servers held
                around 900 petabytes of data.

                A key feature of cloud computing is its ability to give stronger
                performance for machine learning and Artificial intelligence.
                Machine learning is really about the study of algorithms that have
                the ability to learn through patterns and, based on that,
                make predictions against patterns of data. Google has
                intregrated it’s cloud services with its python
                enhanced software, tensorflow for the betterment of
                machine learning.</p>
